My current online activity takes place at [www.reactivesystems.eu](https://www.reactivesystems.eu).

Please visit:

* [My blog](https://www.reactivesystems.eu/)
* [An overview of talks and presentations](https://www.reactivesystems.eu/about/index.html)

Occassionally I post (and, more often, repost) interesting things about all aspects of software development. I suggest you follow me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lutzhuehnken), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lutzh.bsky.social) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lutzh).

If you're looking for a specific repository and can no longer find it here, it's been moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/lutzh), a community-driven, non-profit alternative to Github.
