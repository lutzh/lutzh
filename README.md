Please go to [www.huehnken.de](https://www.huehnken.de/) to find a linktree-style overview of all my online presences. 

Alternatively, visit:

* [My blog](https://www.reactivesystems.eu/).
* [An overview of talks and presentations](https://www.reactivesystems.eu/about/index.html) I've given in the last couple of years.

Occassionally I post interesting things about building and evolving software engineering organizations, crafting resilient and scalable distributed systems with event-driven architecture, and other aspects of software development. I suggest you follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/huehnken.de), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lutzh), or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lutzhuehnken).

If you're looking for a specific repository and can no longer find it here, it's been moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/lutzh), a community-driven, non-profit alternative to Github.
