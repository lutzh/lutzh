You'll find a Linktree-style overview of all my online presences at [www.huehnken.de](https://www.huehnken.de/).

Among them:

* [My blog](https://www.reactivesystems.eu/) on Software Architecture topics.
* The [Awesome Event-Driven Architecture](https://codeberg.org/lutzh/awesome-event-driven-architecture#readme) list of EDA-related links.
* The [Circles Game](https://www.huehnken.de/games/circles/index.html), a 2D Rubik's Cube I vibe coded.

Occasionally I post interesting things about building and evolving software engineering organizations, crafting resilient and scalable distributed systems with event-driven architecture, and other aspects of software development. To get notified of updates, I suggest you follow me on 

* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/huehnken.de) and/or
* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lutzhuehnken) and/or
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lutzh).

If you're looking for a specific repository and can no longer find it here, it maybe moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/lutzh), a community-driven, non-profit alternative to Github that I like to use.
